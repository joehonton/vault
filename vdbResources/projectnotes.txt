Project notes for VaultDLL

See also ProjectNotes.txt in Vault\Vdblib project

use the compile time define USE_WIN to include the <windows.h> file

Compile and link this DLL using the general setting "Use MFC in a Shared DLL".
This also requires all applications to use this general setting as well, otherwise
you will get about 20 "xxxx already defined in libcmt.lib" linker errors.


If this gives you problems try adding this line to your InitInstance routine:

	// turn off MFC new and delete debugging facility
	AfxEnableMemoryTracking( FALSE );
	
Adding this line causes an unhandled exception at program completion as the DLL is
being deleted:	

	afxMemDF = 0;

All of this still doesn't work though as the first free/delete attempts to delete using
the AFX routines which assert.  The allocation routines always adds the diagnostic support.


Let's try building the DLL without MFC support....
