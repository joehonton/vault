Project notes for Vault and VaultDLL

Note 1:
The #define USE_WIN includes <windows.h>
The #define USE_AFX includes <afx.h>

This library and DLL will compile and link with either setting, but any
application that uses MFC should build this library and DLL using USE_AFX
so that the MFC memory manager operator new and operator delete don't fail.

Note 2:
The USE_PRE_HDR must be defined to build the library but does not need to
be defined in the applications which use the library.


Note 3:
Other #defines implicitly set by the compiler unless "undefine all" is set:
_MSC_VER = 900
_M_ALPHA on the Alpha
_M_IX86  on Intel

Other #defines explicitly set:
_ALPHA_ for the Alpha
WIN32 for MYEXPORT


Note 4:
When building the dll define _WINDLL and _USRDLL so that the memory manager
cleans up properly when the dll is shut down.

Note 5:
These problems have started to appear after I created the VaultDLL.  It appears
that accessing MFC from a DLL requires special treatment.  This cascades to all
libraries and apps having to set the switch to use MFC as a DLL.

Note 6:
Setting the general compile options to "Use MFC in a DLL" triggers the define of
_AFXDLL.  This requires the use of _DLL and _MT which are implicitly defined, but
which I override when setting "undefine all".

Note 7:
When _DLL and _MT are explictly defined and the general setting is "Not using MFC",
the symbols "ostream << long" and "__imp_strncat" were undefined when linking InitDB.

Note 8:
The _MT define is for multithreading.  This is required.  The problem first manifested itself
during the constructor to vdbQuery<vdbVersion> as it instantiates _osSelect and _osSort.
The solution is to go back to "Undefine all symbols" unchecked.
(This works with or without:
 	AfxEnableMemoryTracking( FALSE );
 	afxMemDF = 0;
)

Note 9:
Compiler errors on Intel machines from winnt.h
	PCONTEXT : missing decl-specifier
	ContextRecord : missing decl-specifier
    Caused by including windef.h or windows.h when compiling with MFC
	Solution is to include vdbWindows.h and define USE_AFX

Note 10:
Define USE_PRE_HDR when the file vdbHeader.cpp is designated as the precompiled header.
This is the case when building vault.lib and DiceDB.lib
